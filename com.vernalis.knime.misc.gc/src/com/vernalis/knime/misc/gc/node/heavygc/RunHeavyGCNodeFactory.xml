			<p>This node runs a 'heavy' garbage collection. A number of garbage
				collection cycles are run. Between each collection, there is a
				delay, during which System.runFinalization() is called.
			</p>
			<p>It reports the amount of used memory before and after to the
				console log (at the INFO level), and also the total amount of memory
				available to the JVM
			</p>
