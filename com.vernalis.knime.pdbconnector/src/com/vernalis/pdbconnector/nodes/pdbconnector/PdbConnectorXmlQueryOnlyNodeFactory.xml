	<name>PDB Connector Query Only (XML Query)</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Source node to connect to RCSB PDB RESTful Web
		Services for advanced search
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				The
				<i>PDB Connector Query Only (XML Query)</i>
				node provides connections to the RESTful Web Service for searching
				the Protein Data Bank.
			</p>
			<p>
				The query is entered as a single
				XML string
				in this node (For a user-friendly query builder version,
				see the
				original
				<i>PDB Connector</i>
				node). This query can be copied
				and pasted from the "Query Details"
				link on a PDB query results page at
				the
				<a href="http://www.rcsb.org">RCSB PDB</a>
				.
				The XML Query is made available as a flow variable (
				<i>xmlQuery</i>
				) after node execution. Worked examples of using the node
				using these
				methods are provided
				<a
					href="http://tech.knime.org/book/examples-of-using-the-pdb-connector-xml-query-node">here</a>
				.
			</p>

			<p>
				The
				<i>PDB Connector Query Only (XML Query String)</i>
				node was developed by
				<a href="http://www.vernalis.com/">Vernalis (Cambridge, UK)</a>
				, based on the original
				<i>PDB Connector</i>
				node developed by
				<a href="http://www.enspiral-discovery.com/">Enspiral Discovery</a>
				in collaboration with
				<a href="http://www.vernalis.com/">Vernalis (Cambridge, UK)</a>

			<option name="Clear Query">Clear all query options. If a flow variable has

			<option name="Test Query">Test the current query, with display of result
				count. If a flow variable has been
				specified for the xml query, it's
				value will be used in the test. (NB This
				behaviour is different from
				that in the PDB Connector node,
				where the 'Test' button uses the
				query configured in the dialog, without
				reference to flow variable
				settings.). This button also lays out the XML clearly in the XML
				Query String box
