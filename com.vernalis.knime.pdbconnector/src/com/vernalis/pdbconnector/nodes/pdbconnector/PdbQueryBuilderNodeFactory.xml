	<name>PDB Connector XML Query Builder</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Node to build an advanced query XML string for the
		RCSB PDB webservices to
		consume
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				The
				<i>PDB Connector XML Query Builder</i>
				node provides a method to build an advanced PDB query without
				executing the query remotely.
			</p>
			<p>
				The user interface dialog options are designed to be a close mimic
				of the interactive web-based search and reporting options provided
				at
				<a href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/search/advSearch.do">http://www.pdb.org/pdb/search/advSearch.do</a>
				and the user
				is encouraged to explore this resource for a full
				explanation of each
				search option.
				The XML Query is made available as
				a flow variable (
				<i>xmlQuery</i>
				) after node execution.
			</p>

			<p>
				The
				<i>PDB Connector XML Query Builder</i>
				node was developed by
				<a href="http://www.vernalis.com/">Vernalis (Cambridge, UK)</a>
				, based on the original
				<i>PDB Connector</i>
				node developed by
				<a href="http://www.enspiral-discovery.com/">Enspiral Discovery</a>
				in collaboration with
				<a href="http://www.vernalis.com/">Vernalis (Cambridge, UK)</a>
				.
