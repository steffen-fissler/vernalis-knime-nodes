	<name>PDB Connector Query Only</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Source node to connect to RCSB PDB RESTful Web Services for advanced search
		and custom reporting.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				The
				<i>PDB Connector Query Only</i>
				source node provides connections to the RESTful Web Service for
				searching for information from the Protein Data Bank at http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/rest/search
			</p>
			<p>
				The user interface dialog options are designed to be a close mimic
				of the interactive web-based search and reporting options provided
				at
				<a href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/search/advSearch.do">http://www.pdb.org/pdb/search/advSearch.do</a>
				and the user
				is encouraged to explore this resource for a full explanation of each
				search option. Alternatively, use the
				<i>PDB Connector Query only (XML Query)</i>
				node to paste an XML query directly from the "Query Details" link in
				the query results pages on the
				<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb">PDB</a>
				page.
				The XML Query is made available as a flow variable (
				<i>xmlQuery</i>
				) after node execution.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The
				<i>PDB Connector Query Only</i>
				node was developed by
				<a href="http://www.vernalis.com/">Vernalis (Cambridge, UK)</a>
				, based on the original
				<i>PDB Connector</i>
				node developed by
				<a href="http://www.enspiral-discovery.com/">Enspiral Discovery</a>
				in collaboration with
				<a href="http://www.vernalis.com/">Vernalis (Cambridge, UK)</a>
				.
