All Nodes
 * Performance improvements
 * New predefined fragmentation patterns ('MATSY', 'Peptide Sidechains', 'Nucleic Acid Sidechains')
 * Improved rSMARTS validation
 	* Now requires the bond between the two atoms to be both single and acyclic
 	* Allows more complex SMARTS atoms matches (including recursive SMARTS)
 	* No longer requires the SMARTS to be provided as an rSMARTS - although this is still supported 
 			for backwards compatibility
 	* No longer requires atoms to be numbers in the SMARTS match
 	

Filtering
 * Updated faster implementation
 * Streamable

Fragmentation nodes (UPDATED)
 * Performance improvements
 * Memory leaks fixed
 * AP Fingerprint columns have properties describing creation settings to avoid mismatch
 * Graph Distance AP fingerprint vectos added
 * ID can now be the RowID
 * HiLite mapping optionally implemented
 * New Progress View
 * Pass-through of data columns
 * Rendering of fragmentation
 * Complexity filter
 * Behavioural change to remove explicit H's for 1 cut option
 * Additional option regarding incoming explicit H's
 * Streamable

Pair Generation (UPDATED & NEW)
 * Performance improvements
 * HiLite mapping optionally implemented
 * Transforms can be filtered by Heavy-Atom-Count change
 * Transforms can be filtered by Graph distance similarity
 * Remove explicit H's from pair output no longer available as an option
 * Added option to require attachment points to be attached by single, acyclic bonds in SMARTS pattern
 * Pass-through, difference (L-R or R-L) and ratio (L/R or R/L) of data columns from left or right of 
 		transform pair
 * New 'Reference Table' version of pair generation node implemented, only returning transforms between 
 		the rows of the two input tables


Apply Transforms (NEW)
 * New node to apply table of rSMARTS transforms
 * Allows AP-fingerprint environment filtering
 * Node Views showing progress, including currently processed transform(s)

Rendering Nodes (NEW)
 * Show matching bonds (also calculates number of matching bonds)
 * Show cuttable bonds (also calculates number of cuttable bonds)
 * Streamable
