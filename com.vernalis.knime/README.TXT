This plugin contains the PDB Connector KNIME node for advanced search and custom
reporting of the Protein Data Bank, via RCSB PDB RESTful Web Services.  The node
was developed by Enspiral Discovery in collaboration with Vernalis (Cambridge, UK).

The following nodes were developed solely at Vernalis (Cambridge, UK):
The plugin also contains nodes for importing pdb and related files from the RCSB
PDB and local repositories and exporting to local repositories.  Further nodes
extract properties from pdb files and FASTA sequences.

Additionally, the SMARTSViewer node renders SMARTS strings using the 
www.smartsviewer.de web service.

Utility nodes are provided to generate random numbers, and to list (sub)folders
within a specified location.
