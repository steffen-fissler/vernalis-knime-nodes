    <name>PDB Sequence Extractor</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Node to extract sequence(s) from PDB Cell column, using either the SEQRES records
         or the Co-ordinate block
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>The <i>PDB Sequence Extractor</i> node extracts all chain sequences from a PDB cell.
         A new row is added to the output table for each chain, and the chain ID is always added.  
         The sequences can be enumerated in any of 4 ways:
         <ul>
         <li>‘Raw’ 3-letter sequence(s) from the SEQRES records</li>
         <li>‘Sanitized’ 1-letter sequence(s) from the SEQRES records (This option should give
         identical results to those obtained from the PDB FASTA file download and FASTA Sequence Extractor node)</li>
         <li>‘Raw’ 3-letter sequence(s) from the co-ordinates block</li>
         <li>‘Sanitized’ 1-letter sequence(s) from the co-ordinates block</li>
         </ul>
         If co-ordinates sequences are extracted, then a Model ID column will also be included in the output.
         Optionally, HETATM records can be included in co-ordinates-derived the sequence(s). 
         If no sequences are selected, then only a list of chains will be returned.  The list of chains
         will consist of all chains found in SEQRES or Co-ordinate blocks (the latter respecting the <i>Include HETATM</i> option setting), 
         regardless of which sequences are extracted.
         <p>
         <i>'Sanitization'</i> is as follows (which follows as closely as possible the process 
         implemented by the <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/pdb">PDB</a>):
         <ul>
         <li>Phosphorylated, Sulfated, Acylated and Side-chain Methylated amino acids are converted 
         to their unmodified parents</li>
         <li>D-Amino acids are converted to their L-Amino acid counterparts</li>
         <li>DNA residues (e.g. DA) are converted to the corresponding RNA residue (e.g. A)</li>
         </ul>
         For SEQRES residues, the mappings are taken from the MODRES record in the PDB file.  For co-ordinate
          sequences, tha mappings are from a built-in dictionary, in case the MODRES record is incomplete. 'X' is used for
          non-deciphered residues, and '?' for sequence gaps in the co-ordinate sequences.</p>
