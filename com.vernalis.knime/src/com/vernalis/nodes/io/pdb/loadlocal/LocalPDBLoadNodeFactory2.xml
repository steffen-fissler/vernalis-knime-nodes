	<name>PDB Loader</name>

	<shortDescription>
        Load a local copy of a PDB files from a column of source filepaths or URLs
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Loads PDB files specified by a valid full file path or URL into a
			table.
			<br />
			Files may be local or remote, as long as the URL is accessible.
			<br />
			Only paths ending .pdb or .pdb.gz will be loaded. The resulting
			column will be cast as PDBCells.
			<p>
				File encoding is attempted as follows:
				<ol>
					<li>Firstly, the URL connection to the supplied
						file is inspected
						for encoding information.
					</li>
					<li>
						If none is available, then the first 4 bytes of the file are
						inspected for any
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark">BOM</a>
						present, and if so, the following are recognised:
						UTF-8, UTF-16 (Big- and Little Endian), UTF-32 (Big- and Little Endian).
					</li>
					<li>
						Finally, the default (UTF-8) is assumed. As UTF-8 is not
						required
						to provide a BOM, this is a reasonable guess in
						<i>most</i>
						cases.
					</li>
				</ol>
				A console
				<i>INFO</i>
				entry is added for each file format detected, and a
				<i>WARN</i>
				entry added when the default is used because none could be
				detected.
				If manual control of the file encoding is required, then the
				<i>Load text-based files</i>
				node should be used, followed by a
				<i>Molecule Type Cast</i>
				node
