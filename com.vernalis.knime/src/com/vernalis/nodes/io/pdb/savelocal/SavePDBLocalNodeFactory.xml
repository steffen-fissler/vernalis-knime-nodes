	<shortDescription>
		Node to save a PDB cell column to a local file with
		path specified in a
		second column
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node saves a copy of the PDB files held in a table column to
			filepaths held in a second column.
			<br />
			A rudimentary attempt is made to validate the filepaths - which must
			be complete paths, e.g. C:\Temp\myfile.pdb
			If the full folder path
			does not exist, an attempt is made to create
			it.
			<br />
			The returned column will contain a missing value if either of the
			input columns is a missing value, '
			<i>true</i>
			' if the file
			was successfully written, and '
			<i>false</i>
			' if it was not written (i.e. because overwrite was set to off, and
			the file existed, or
			because the directory could not be created or was
			not a valid path.)
