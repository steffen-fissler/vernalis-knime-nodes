    <name>Save File Locally</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Node to save a String column to a local file with path specified in a second column
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node saves a copy of the text files held in a table column to filepaths held in a second column.<br />
         A rudimentary attempt is made to validate the filepaths - which must be complete paths, e.g. C:\Temp\myfile.txt
         If the full folder path does not exist, an attempt is made to create it.<br />
         The returned column will contain a missing value if either of the input columns is a missing value, 'true' if the file
         was successfully written, and 'false' if it was not written (i.e. because overwrite was set to off, and the file existed, or
         because the directory could not be created or was not a valid path)<br />
         This node can be used to create txt files, or save pdb, mol, mol2 files etc. by providing an appropriate
         filepath and extension.
