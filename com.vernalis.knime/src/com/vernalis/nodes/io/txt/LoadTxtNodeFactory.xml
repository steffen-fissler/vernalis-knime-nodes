	<shortDescription>
		Node to Load text-based files to a column in the
		table
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>Loads text-based files into a new table column from a column of
				URLs or full filepaths. Each file is added in its entirety
				to a
				single
				multi-line String cell in a new column added to the output
				table. The
				column can then be re-typed
				(e.g. to mol, mol2, PDB etc.)
				as required.
			</p>
			<p>
				File encoding is attempted as follows when the '
				<i>Guess</i>
				' option is selected:
				<ol>
					<li>Firstly, the URL connection to the supplied
						file is inspected
						for encoding information.
					</li>
					<li>
						If none is available, then the first 4 bytes of the file are
						inspected for any
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark">BOM</a>
						present, and if so, the following are recognised: UTF-8, UTF-16
						(Big- and Little Endian), UTF-32 (Big- and Little Endian)
					</li>
					<li>
						Finally, the default (UTF-8) is assumed. As UTF-8 is not
						required
						to provide a BOM, this is a reasonable guess in
						<i>most</i>
						cases.
					</li>
				</ol>
				A console
				<i>INFO</i>
				entry is added for each file format detected, and a
				<i>WARN</i>
				entry added when the default is used because none could be
				detected.
