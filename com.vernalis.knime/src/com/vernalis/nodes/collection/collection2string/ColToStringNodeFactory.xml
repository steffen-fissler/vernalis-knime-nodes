	<shortDescription>
		Converts one or more collection (list or set) columns
		to strings
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>The node converts one or more collection columns to a string
				representation. Each individual cell in the collection is converted
				using its 'toString()' method. Missing cells within collections can
				optionally be skipped. The separator string between cells can be
				changed. Individual cells can have prefixes and/or suffixes, and the
				entire collection can have a prefix and/or suffix. Any of these can
				include 'special' characters e.g. \t (tab), \n (new line) etc., or
				be left empty
