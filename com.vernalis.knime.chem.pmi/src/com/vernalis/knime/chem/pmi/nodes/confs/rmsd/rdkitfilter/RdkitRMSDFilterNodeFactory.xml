	<name>RMSD Conformer List Filter</name>

	<shortDescription>
        Node to filter conformers by RMSD. 
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				This node filters conformers according to an RMSD threshold. All
				conformers of a molecule must be in a List cell in a single row.
			</p>
			<p>Filtering is performed by calculating the RMSD for each conformer
				against all kept so far for the current molecule, and only keeping
				those which have a minimum RMSD to a previously kept conformer
				greater than the threshold value
			</p>
			<p>Other non-molecule format List columns can be selected and
				filtered according to whether the corresponding conformer was kept
				or removed. If a list cell has a different number of members than
				the conformers cell, it will not be filtered (it will either be kept
				unchanged, or replaced with a missing cell according to the node
				configuration), and the row will be
				added to the warning message at
				the end of the node execution
			</p>

		<option name="Conformers">The input molecule column containing the
			conformers. Accepted formats are Lists of MOL, SDF and RDKit

		<option name="Conformer Properties Columns">Lists of properties associated with the conformers
			to be filtered
		</option>
		<option name="Replace unfilterable list cells with missing values">If this option is selected, list cells which
			cannot be filtered by virtue of having a different number of members
			to the incoming conformer column will be replaced with a missing
			value cell rather than being passed through unchanged</option>

		<option name="Ignore H's">Hydrogen atoms are ignored. Significant
			performance increases can be obtained selecting this option.
